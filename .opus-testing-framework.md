# Simple-Secrets CLI — AI Agent QA Testing Framework v3.0

> **Testing Philosophy**: Use AI agents as intelligent QA engineers who can think creatively, discover edge cases, and simulate real user behavior that automated tests miss.

## 🎯 **Systematic Command Coverage Foundation**

### Phase 0: Help System Intelligence Gathering (REQUIRED FIRST)

**Goal**: Establish comprehensive command understanding before creative testing

**AI Agent Instructions:**
```
Before any creative testing, you must systematically map the application:

1. Run `./simple-secrets --help` and catalog every command listed
2. For each command, run `./simple-secrets [command] --help` 
3. Document all flags, arguments, usage patterns, and examples
4. Create mental model of command relationships and workflow
5. Note any inconsistencies, missing help, or unclear documentation
6. Identify which commands might interact with each other
7. Map out potential failure points and edge cases from help alone
```

**Help System Analysis Checklist:**
- [ ] **Main help completeness**: All features mentioned in help actually work
- [ ] **Command help accuracy**: Each command's help reflects actual behavior  
- [ ] **Example validity**: All examples in help work as documented
- [ ] **Flag completeness**: All mentioned flags function correctly
- [ ] **Usage pattern coverage**: All documented patterns work
- [ ] **Terminology consistency**: Same concepts use same terms throughout
- [ ] **Missing features**: Features that exist but aren't documented in help

**Command Discovery Matrix:**
Based on help system, create testing coverage map for each command with these personas:
- New User (confusion points?)
- Power User (advanced usage?)  
- Malicious Actor (security concerns?)
- DevOps Engineer (automation needs?)
- Data Analyst (bulk operations?)
- Chaos Agent (unexpected combinations?)

## 🤖 AI Agent Testing Instructions

You are a QA engineer testing this CLI application. Your goal is to:

1. **Think like a user** - both experienced and novice
2. **Think like an attacker** - try to break things
3. **Think like a developer** - understand the implementation
4. **Be creative** - find edge cases humans might miss

### Your Testing Persona Options

Assume the role of each of these and test one by one:

- 🆕 **New User**: First time using the app, makes common mistakes
- 👨‍💻 **Power User**: Knows CLI tools well, uses advanced features
- 😈 **Malicious Actor**: Actively trying to break security
- 🔧 **DevOps Engineer**: Needs it to work in production
- 📊 **Data Analyst**: Stores lots of secrets, needs performance
- 🎭 **Chaos Agent**: Does unexpected, random things

## 📋 Enhanced Interactive Testing Protocol

### Phase 1: Discovery & Learning

**Goal**: Understand the application naturally, like a real user would

```
As an AI agent, start here:
1. Try to use the app WITHOUT reading documentation first
2. Note what's intuitive vs confusing
3. Document your learning curve
4. What assumptions did you make that were wrong?
5. What error messages were helpful vs cryptic?
```

**Questions to explore:**

- What happens if I just type `./simple-secrets`?
- Can I guess the command structure?
- Do error messages teach me how to use it correctly?
- What's my first "aha!" moment?

### 🏷️ **Version System Discovery Testing**

**Goal**: Test version system like a user discovering it naturally

```
Version exploration tasks:
1. How does a user discover version information?
2. Is version info consistent across commands?
3. What does version tell you about the build?
4. Does version behavior match user expectations?
```

**Discovery scenarios:**

- Try `--version`, `-v`, `version` - what works?
- What's the difference between `version` and `version --short`?
- Does version info help with debugging?
- Can you tell if you're running dev vs release build?
- What happens if you run an old binary after updating?

**Version edge cases:**

- Does version work without authentication?
- What if git isn't available during build?
- Version display with terminal width constraints
- Copy/paste version info for bug reports

### Phase 2: Destructive Creativity

**Goal**: Find bugs through creative destruction

```
Now actively try to break things:
1. What inputs would a user NEVER intentionally provide?
2. What sequence of commands creates unexpected states?
3. Can you corrupt data through normal operations?
4. What happens during race conditions?
5. Can you exhaust resources?
```

**Creative destruction examples:**

- Put a secret with key `../../etc/passwd`
- Create circular references in values
- Use null bytes, control characters, ANSI escape codes
- Rapidly rotate keys while reading secrets
- Fill the disk during a backup operation
- Delete files while the app is reading them
- Test empty arguments (note: may trigger interactive prompts - use Ctrl+C or timeout in automation)

### Phase 3: Behavioral Exploration

**Goal**: Discover undocumented behaviors and edge cases

```
Explore the boundaries:
1. What's the largest secret you can store?
2. What's the longest key name that works?
3. How many users can you create?
4. What happens with 10,000 secrets?
5. Can you predict the token generation pattern?
```

**Behavioral tests to try:**

- Store a secret that's another encrypted secret
- Create users with emoji names
- Use the app in different locales/languages
- Run multiple instances simultaneously
- Test timezone changes during operations
- What if system time goes backwards?

## 🎯 Critical Bug Hunt Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Paranoid Security Auditor

```
You're a security auditor. Your job is to find any way that secrets
could leak or unauthorized access could occur.

Try:
- Can you access secrets without proper authentication?
- Can you escalate from reader to admin?
- Do errors reveal information about secret existence?
- Can you predict or forge tokens?
- Is there any timing attack possible?
- Can you access other users' data?
```

### Scenario 2: The Disaster Recovery Specialist

```
You're testing disaster recovery. Assume everything that can go
wrong will go wrong at the worst possible moment.

Simulate:
- Power failure during master key rotation
- Corrupted backup files
- Partial file writes
- Missing dependencies
- Wrong file permissions
- Disk full at critical moments
- Network partition during operations
```

### Scenario 3: The Integration Nightmare

```
You need to integrate this with existing systems that have
weird requirements and constraints.

Test:
- Secrets with JSON that breaks parsers
- Keys that conflict with environment variables
- Values that look like command injection
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Secrets rotation during active use
- Migration from other secret stores
```

## 🔍 AI-Specific Testing Advantages

### Pattern Recognition Tests

**Use your pattern recognition to find issues:**

- Do error messages follow consistent patterns?
- Are there commands that behave inconsistently?
- Can you spot potential race conditions in the workflow?
- Do you see any security anti-patterns?
- Are there performance cliffs at certain thresholds?

### Natural Language Exploitation

**Use your language understanding:**

- Create secrets with multilingual content
- Use homoglyphs and lookalike characters
- Test with RTL (right-to-left) text
- Use zero-width characters
- Test with various encodings

### Sequence Prediction

**Use your sequence learning:**

- Can you predict the next token value?
- Is there a pattern in backup naming?
- Can you guess file locations?
- Are there predictable temporary files?
