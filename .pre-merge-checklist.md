**CRITICAL**: After any substantial changes during the validation process (such as authentication system modernization, architectural refactoring, security vulnerability fixes, or significant code restructuring), the AI assistant MUST restart this entire checklist from Phase 1, Step 1.0. (PERMANENT RULE)

**CRITICAL**: After any substantial changes during the validation process (such as authentication system modernization, architectural refactoring, security vulnerability fixes, or significant code restructuring), the AI assistant MUST restart this entire checklist from Phase 1, Step 1.0.

**Rationale**: Substantial changes can introduce new issues, affect multiple subsystems, or invalidate previous validation steps. A complete restart ensures:

- All validation steps account for the latest changes
- No validation gaps from incremental checking
- Comprehensive quality assurance after architectural modifications
- Fresh evaluation of the complete system state

**Examples of changes requiring restart**:

- Authentication system modernization
- Major refactoring of core components
- Security vulnerability remediation
- API or CLI interface changes
- Cross-cutting architectural improvements

## 📋 Pre-Merge Validation Sequence

### Phase 1: Code Quality & SOLID Reviewon Checklist

## 🎯 Purpose

This checklist ensures comprehensive validation before merging code changes. It consolidates multiple testing frameworks and quality checks into a single, repeatable process that guarantees merge-readiness.

### Phase 1: Code Quality & SOLID Review

### Pre-Validation Setup

� **Environment Token Check**:

```bash
env | grep -i simple
# Note: SIMPLE_SECRETS_TOKEN is often set from previous testing - this is expected.
# Just be aware it will auto-authenticate during testing.
```

🚨 **Installation State Check**:

```bash
ls ~/.simple-secrets
# If directory exists, you're seeing existing installation state
# ALWAYS test fresh installation by using isolated environment:
# export SIMPLE_SECRETS_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/test-clean && rm -rf /tmp/test-clean
# Fresh installation testing is REQUIRED regardless of existing installations
```

**Purpose**: Early validation of code architecture, clean code principles, and merge-readiness

#### 1.0 Test Suite Validation (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)

- ✅ **Build Verification**: `make clean && make dev` succeeds with current commit hash
  - ⚠️ **NEVER use `go build` directly** - always use `make dev` for proper version injection
  - ✅ **Version Check**: `./simple-secrets version` shows proper commit hash (not "unknown")
  - ✅ **Short Version**: `./simple-secrets version --short` shows `dev-abc1234` format
- ✅ **Test Execution**: `make test` runs with 100% pass rate (0 failed tests)
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Core functionality covered by unit and integration tests
- ✅ **Concurrency Tests**: All concurrent operations tests pass without data loss
- ✅ **Performance Tests**: No regressions in test execution time
- ⚠️ **MERGE BLOCKER**: Any test failures must be fixed before proceeding

#### 1.1 SOLID Principles Review

- ✅ **Single Responsibility**: Each function/struct has one clear purpose
- ✅ **Open/Closed**: Code is extensible without modification
- ✅ **Liskov Substitution**: Interfaces are properly implemented
- ✅ **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are focused and minimal
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies are properly abstracted

#### 1.2 Clean Code Validation

- ✅ **Method Extraction**: Complex logic broken into meaningful methods
- ✅ **Variable Naming**: Names express intent clearly
- ✅ **Abstraction Levels**: Methods operate at consistent abstraction levels
- ✅ **Early Returns**: Avoid `else` branches, use guard clauses
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages
- ✅ **Comments**: Minimal, only where absolutely necessary

### **1.3 Architecture & Design Validation**

- [ ] **Domain-driven structure**: `pkg/` contains public interfaces, `internal/` has implementations
- [ ] **Service composition**: `internal/platform/` properly wires all domain services together
- [ ] **Interface boundaries**: Clean domain boundaries between secrets, users, auth, rotation
- [ ] **Platform readiness**: Business logic accessible through public interfaces for API extension
- [ ] **Context integration**: All domain operations accept and properly handle `context.Context`
- [ ] **Repository pattern**: Storage abstracted behind domain-appropriate interfaces
- [ ] **Error handling**: Consistent domain error types with proper wrapping and context
- [ ] **Resource management**: Proper cleanup of resources with context cancellation support
- [ ] **Configuration handling**: Platform configuration composable and injectable
- [ ] **Dependency injection**: Platform services composed via factory pattern with options

- ✅ **Flag Coverage**: All global flags (`--version`, `-v`, `--help`, `--token`) tested
- ✅ **Command Variants**: All usage patterns and argument combinations covered
- ✅ **Error Scenarios**: Invalid commands, missing args, wrong syntax all tested

#### 2.5 Help System Consistency Validation (CRITICAL)

- ✅ **Help-to-Implementation Accuracy**: Every flag/option in help actually works as described

- ✅ **Documentation Alignment**: README examples match help examples exactly
- ✅ **Flag Consistency**: Same flags described consistently across all commands
- ✅ **Terminology Consistency**: Same terms used consistently throughout help system
- ✅ **Feature Coverage**: All implemented features mentioned in appropriate help sections
- ✅ **Testing Framework Sync**: Help system changes reflected in testing framework command inventory

#### 2.6 Unit Test Coverage Validation

- ✅ **Test-to-Code Mapping**: Every public function has corresponding unit test

- ✅ **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions, null inputs, empty values tested
- ✅ **Mock Validation**: External dependencies properly mocked and tested
- ✅ **Integration Points**: All module interactions have integration tests
- ✅ **Regression Coverage**: Previously fixed bugs have regression tests
- ✅ **Performance Tests**: Critical operations have performance validation

#### 2.7 Quality Standards Validation

- ✅ **Documentation Quality**: Clear, actionable, error-free writing
- ✅ **Example Quality**: Examples are realistic, useful, and current
- ✅ **User Experience**: Documentation flows logically for intended audience
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Documentation is clear for users at different skill levels
- ✅ **Completeness**: No gaps between what code does and what docs say

**Expected Outcome**: Perfect synchronization between code, documentation, examples, and tests

### Phase 3: Persona-Based Testing Framework

**Purpose**: AI simulating different user personas testing their perception and experience with the application
**Reference**: `.persona-based-testing-guide.md`

Execute the complete persona-based testing framework covering:

- ✅ **AI-Specific Testing**: Pattern recognition, natural language exploitation, sequence prediction
- ✅ **Gamified Challenges**: Speedrun corruption, secret hoarder, token collector, time traveler, minimalist, maximalist
- ✅ **Iterative Testing Cycles**: Innocent explorer → Power user → Hostile actor → Production simulator → Integration tester
- ✅ **Creative Edge Cases**: Multi-persona combinations, compound failure scenarios, interaction bugs

**Expected Outcome**: All personas tested, creative edge cases discovered, no critical security or functionality issues, concurrent operations validated
